# NanaAutoMotdPlugin
A Minecraft plugin for customizing the motds (usefull for Anarchy servers and smps)
# How to use?
1. Drag the downloaded jar file into the plugins folder at your server
2. Restart the server and a config.yml file should show up in a NanaAutoMotd folder
3. Customize the motd as you want it
# Config.yml
The config.yml file will show up in a NanaAutoMotd folder, after a restart.
The file has 2 options: motd and random.
The motd option is for your motd and the random option is a List of different texts that can be called with the %random% tag (view below!)
# Customization
You can put plain text in here but that is booring!
So you can color using ยง followed by a color code. You can find color codes here for exmaple: https://htmlcolorcodes.com/bukkit-color-codes
My plugin also allows tags. Tags are called by using %tag% and they are placeholders for other text.

These tags are possible:
  - %random% | This tag will choose a random text from the rando list
  - %players_online% | This tag shows the amount of online players
  - %players_max% | This tag shows the maximum of players allowed my the server
  - %players_all% | This tag shows how many individual players joined the server
